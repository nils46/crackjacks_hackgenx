here we are using  S2A_MSIL1C_20220516_Train_GT.tif to train on basis of S2A_MSIL1C_20220516_Train_GT.tif ground truth data
. we implemented one classification model for it, and we are using concept of ploting classifiaction model on image before and after . so we taken dataset for testing from kaggle ,which is having sentinel-1 as before and sentinel-2 as after image. so by classifying this image we get 2 image of same forest as classied with diffrent vegetation index.
input for before and after image taken from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13jo2BtjDrKe1RnCPFe3koVccDjdkO_QJ?usp=drive_link


we've used satellite sentinel 2 images for particular region and particular time period and visulize it on the map
